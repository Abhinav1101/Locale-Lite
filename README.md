This is an app for finding nearby service providers providing services like electrician, plumber, carpenter, etc.

On opening the app you will see a switch to enter the app as a user or as a service provider. There is also a button for admin about which we will know later.

This is an app where users may log in inside the app without actually providing any information about himself/herself i.e. anonymously. I have done this to ensure the security of the user so that no one gets afraid of the risk of security from this app.
When a user login he/she can find services like electrician, plumber, and carpenter on the activity opened just after that. User can click on any service and will see those service providers which are in the range of 5Km from their location on the map.
User will also see their location in purple colored marker and the rest of the markers are in red color showing the location of the service providers.
Now, Users can see what all are the service providers nearest to whom he/she can call for help. For contacting any service provider users can click on the green chat button present on the top right corner of the phone screen.
On clicking on the chat button user will see a list of service providers' addresses on the screen. On clicking any of the addresses a new activity of chat will open where users can chat with that service provider.
Again, for chatting I am not asking contact information of users so there is no risk of security. Here in chat window users can chat with different service providers and tell his/her issue and ask for approximate price and also negotiate if needed.
If users find that the utility provider is not good or asking more money then in that case he/she can chat with any other utility provider. In this way, users can fix the deal and ask for the utility provider's payment UPI for paying the visiting charge.
This system of paying visiting charges is there so that only genuine users can call any utility provider and not fake demand. Users will see payment UPI option on top of the list where different service providers are listed from their address.
On entering the details user can make payment and then utility provider will visit their house. Once users get service that they want they can log out from the app to delete their chat from the database that will ensure that the developer is not storing a single bit of information about the user.


Now, coming to the procedure of using the app as a utility provider. Utility providers have to signup for using the app. After signup, they will log in and see active users on their screen.
By active users, I mean those users who are currently looking for any service. The utility provider can chat with the user on clicking on the unique id with which each user is listed on the screen of the utility provider.
Here on clicking the user's unique id chat window will open and the utility provider will get to know the problem of the user and can ask for the price for fixing it.
The utility provider has the option to logout and login again from a menu provided on the top right corner of the screen.

Now, coming to the role of admin. Admin can verify the utility provider by contacting them whenever any service provider will signup in the app. This is so to ensure that only genuine service provider will get to show on the map to any user and not any fake utility provider
Admin can click on the admin button and see services like electrician, plumber, and carpenter. When admin will click on any service a map will open and admin can mark the location of the service provider who has recently registered with the app after verifying the authenticity of that utility provider.
On long press on map admin can mark the location and then a dialog box will prompt asking the username of that service provider and on filling that the location will get marked in the app and whenever any user who is in 5Km range of that service provider opens the app looking for that service can see the location of that utility provider marked on the map.
In the user version of the app, the admin button will be invisible and so only the developer can mark the location of any utility provider after verification.
